pythontests
===========

Just a bunch of python examples I'm writing for either testing purposes or that I use in class!
- Basic Python: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Functions, etc
- Working with Files: Text and Binary
- Networking: TCP, UDP, FTP, HTTP, SMTP, etc

Feel free to use them if you find them useful.
